### Overview
Made for second half of the Summer 2023 Practical Game Dev course at Texas State University.

Intended to be a rock-paper-scissors battle simulator for a roguelite game.

### BUG NOTES
- Enemy health doesn't reset to maximum when continuing.

### Future Updates
- Use the player score to scale enemy health and damage.
- Switch AI from switch statements to 4-state Finite State Machine.
- More polish to character "animations".

### Update on Progress as of 9/12/2023
- Project is abandoned due to poor management when creating the scripts from the ground up.
- May return to remake this from the ground up.
